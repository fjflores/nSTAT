Issues with examples:
- When plotting history, the y-label is not correct, and issues a warning.
- Simulate PP by thinning has a problem in the axis 
    - v=axis;
    - axis([0 Tmax/4 v(3) v(4)]);
- Analysis.GLMFit
    - Only 1 worker is being used (may be because of one neuron?).
    - Warning: Weights are ill-conditioned.   Data may be badly scaled, or
    the link function may be inappropriate. Why is this?
